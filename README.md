Introduction

Natural Language Processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. It involves various techniques to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a manner that is both meaningful and useful. This repository offers a series of tutorials and code examples based on Steven Bird's well-regarded textbook, aiming to provide a solid foundation in NLP for those interested in learning more about the field.

Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository and follow the instructions provided in each tutorial. Each tutorial contains a Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step explanations and code examples, as well as accompanying resources, such as datasets and supplementary materials.

It is recommended that you have a basic understanding of Python programming, as the code examples are written in Python. Familiarity with machine learning concepts may also be helpful, but not strictly necessary.

Tutorials

The tutorials included in this repository cover various NLP topics, such as:

Tokenization
Part-of-Speech Tagging
Named Entity Recognition
Sentiment Analysis
Text Summarization
Machine Translation
... and more!
Code Examples
